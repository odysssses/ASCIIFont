# ASCIIFont
HI! What this code does is it inputs a text that will turn into an ASCII art. You can also input a text file which is neat (Spaces will default to @) [WARNING: Doubles in size (25kB -> 50kB) lol] 
You can also make your font image and use it, just: 1. Pick or create a font 2. Place all the characters in the guidelines on its place (image editor) 3. Remove the guidelines 4. Save the image on the directory 5. Copy the file name 6. Paste it on line 17 and 18 instead of "systemBold.png". DONE!!! 
Not very optmized but I like it
